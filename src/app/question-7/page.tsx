        This can be achieve in a few ways, you could for example implement a
        redirect directly in your project. If you are using Next.js you could
        use the{" "}
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects">
          redirects api
        </a>{" "}
        or if you want something more dynamic you could use{" "}
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware">
          Next.js' middleware
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        You could also take advantage of{" "}
        <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/quickstart">
          Vercel's Edge Middleware
        </a>
        this has the benefit of redirecting your visitors in less time, as the
        edge middleware is deployed closer to your customers thanks to our{" "}
        <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview">Edge Network</a>
      </p>

        If you are not using Next.js and here is{" "}

          how to take advantage of the edge network to redirect your users.
