        You can tell all the search engines to not index either certain paths of
        your app or all the paths by serving a file with the name{" "}
        <code>robots.txt</code>
        from the root of your app. Here is how it can be done on{" "}
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/robots">
          Next.js for example
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to learn more about how search engines interpret this file
        here are some{" "}

          documentation by google
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find how to write one and a good example of the specific use
